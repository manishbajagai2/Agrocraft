    <h1>About Us </h1>

    <p>We try collecting products from several producers with their consent and sell it to individual houses to increase sales and profitability. This wil be sales done by the farmer direct to the consumer.Different studies show that many consumers
      prefer direct contact with the producer/seller compared to an impersonal service. One of the main advantages of direct sales to consumers is the opportunity to reduce marketing costs and to add value to the product. The value will be added by
      the consumer itself through ratings. In this way, the profit margin for the producer will be increased.This is because of factors such as number of intermediaries, cost of various market functions rendered by intermediaries,spread of location
      of the producers and consumers. Further the degree of perish-ability, variety and quality, and various market imperfections, market infrastructure etc. influence the marketing costs and price levels. Hence we provide financial exchange arena
      for both producers and consumers.</p>
    <p>Sometimes bringing fruits and vegetables to market requires special handling. To preserve quality and maintain marketability, each crop must be harvested, prepared for market, packaged, and shipped from farm gate to the ultimate user. So,
      awareness of producers', ready to sell stacks of fruits or vegetables around the consumers' own interest is boost up by the use of this web platform and show availability.This becomes beneficial instead of calculating time spent in
      transportation and finding space in market. We promote small-scale growers to gain consumers because sometimes small scale farmers may find hard to set themselves in the market.</p>
